ðŸ§  Problem:  Difficulty: Medium Link: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/chocolate-distribution-problem/]
Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

Each student gets exactly one packet.
The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 3 
Output: 2 
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2. 

Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 5 
Output: 7
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4, 9, 7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9 - 2 = 7. 

âœ… Solution (Python):

def findMinDiff(arr, m):
    n = len(arr)

    # Sort the given packets
    arr.sort()

    minDiff = float('inf')

    for i in range(n - m + 1):

        # calculate difference of current window
        diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i]

        # if current difference is smaller
        # then update the minimum difference
        if diff < minDiff:
            minDiff = diff

    return minDiff

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56]
    m = 3

    print(findMinDiff(arr, m))

ðŸ§  Explanation: 
We use a greedy + sliding window approach after sorting the array:

-Sort the Array

-Sorting ensures that we can compare only contiguous subsets (windows) of size m to get minimum difference.

-Example: After sorting [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56], we get [2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 56].

-Slide a Window of Size m Across the Sorted Array

-For each window arr[i] to arr[i + m - 1], calculate the difference:
diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i]

-Track the minimum difference seen so far.

-Return the Minimum Difference

-This is the most balanced way to distribute the chocolates.

Time: O(nlogn)
