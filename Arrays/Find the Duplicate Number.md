ðŸ§  Problem: 287 Difficulty: Medium Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/]

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

âœ… Solution (Python):
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[0]
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        fast = nums[0]
        while (slow!=fast):
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]
        return fast
        
ðŸ§  Explanation: 
-Modeled the array as a linked list

-The duplicate creates a cycle

-Used Floyd's algorithm to detect the cycle and locate the duplicate

Time: O(n)
